To the world you might be just one person
But to me you are the world.

To __love__ a person is to
see all of their magic,
and to remind them
of it when they have
forgotten. <3

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal Grace.
